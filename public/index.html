		<h1>Hello! I am Franz Harvey B. Salvador.</h1>

		<p>I am currently 14 years old, and have lived in Pasig City for most of my life. I also visit my Grandma and my Aunt's houses during weekends and occassions.</p>

		<p>My aspirations are to be a lawyer that overpowers everyone with sheer facts and knowledge, as I have always liked to debate people on certain facts and evidence. But, I also want to be an artist. Not being a serious artist, I just want to be skilled enough in it to impress people with my skill. I like to doodle and sketch alot (refer to my friends and my sketchbooks), so I feel like I want to pursue art as a 2nd degree.</p>

		<p>My interests are many, One of them being piano. I have a friend (and groupmate) that plays piano, and I thought: "Why not learn to play piano myself? It seems fun.", and that's how I managed to become semi-good in piano. I also tried a bit of guitar, learning a little bit on the fretboard and chords, but nothing serious.</p>

		<p>One of my many other interests is that I like creating fanfics of certain fandoms. I'm currently doing a Persona 5 Royal and RWBY fanfic, with a Oneshot Compilation and DDLC fanfic on the way.</p>

		Lastly, I like to play video games. I like to play with my friends on Roblox, with games such as: Forsaken, Outcome Memories, Pacer, and many more. Aside from Roblox, I also dabble a bit on minecraft, having made a medieval home, and a lot of redstone builds, many of them were failed.</p>

		<h3>About me:</h3>
		<p>Hello, I am Jian Richie S. Perez, in grade 9-Bl. Mark of Aviano, In the private school of
			LSM. I been livin in Pasig, Greenwoods executive village however, I began to live in a condo at Kai Garden.
			One of my favorite habit is that I'll take long walks around my house or within the school grounds.
			Another thing that I like to do is swimm in the water and represent my school in every competitions.
			However, I mostly swimm just to stay fit and strong, not to become some famous athelete and be well known
			Internationally or be the number one swimmer in the country. I wanna become a doctor, focused on
			physiatrist,
			a doctor who studies the mind, and behavior, to help people with mental, emotional,
			and behavioral disorders. They can also find ways to improve the patient living conditions. The reason why I
			wanna be a doctor is to follow the foot steps of my mother and father since
			my mother is a high ranking doctor in the mental hostpital </p>

		<h1 class="text-center">Who is your selected Filipino Inspiration?</h1>
		<h1>Fe Villanueva del Mundo</h1>

		<p>A pediatrician doctor who made the pediatric hospital in the country,
			and she focused on changing the modern child healthcare system in the Philippines.
			She also focused on researching diseases such as dengue, polio and measles. During the Japan invasion,
			she joined the International Red cross, but was detained in UST for foreign nationals. However this
			doesnt stop her as she makes a hospice within the University,
			and her actions/medical assistance led her to be known as "The Angel of Santo Tomas" </p>
		<p> The reason why Dr. Del Mundo inspire me, is because no matter how big or small, necessasary or not
			needed, easy or hard, you must always execute that role, 100%. Since every role will always benifits someone
